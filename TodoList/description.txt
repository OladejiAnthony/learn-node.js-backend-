#Learning Curve:
1. appLearn.js - in the package.json file change to this "main": "appLearn.js",
2. appList.js - in the package.json file change to this "main": "appList.js",
3. app.js


/*EJS Templating*/
EJS - Embedded Javascript Templating.
EJS lets use use templates that lets us create lots of pages that are similar to eachother. e.g a list with different items.
We will learn how to use EJS with express.

 EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

  -npm install ejs
  npm i ejs
  -Tell our app to use ejs as its view engine:
  app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
  -Use ejs view engine to render pages
  app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.render("index", {foo: 'Foo'})
  })

 -use ejs marker in the ui to render variables
  <%= EJS %>!
  - EJS Tags
  <% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow i.e if-else statements, no output
  <%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
  <%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template

/*Scope in JS*/
1. Function Scope/Local Variables
creating a variable inside a function and can only be accessed within that function
  function a {
    var x = 2;
    console.log(x);
  }
2. Global Scope/Variables
creating a variable outside a function but it can be accessed either inside a function or anywhere else in your code
    var x = 2;
  function a {
    console.log(x);
  }
  console.log(x)

creating a variable inside control-loops but you can access the variable both inside and outside the control loop
if(true) {
  var x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

Variable Kerwords -
const - its value cannot be changed 
var - 
let - 
  It is in relation to scope that both var and let keywords behave slightly differently, even though their values do changes.
  If you create a var, let or const variable inside a function, they are all local variables and can only be used inside that function.
  But if you create any of the three variables outside a function they are all global variables and have global scope and can be accessed anywhere inside your file.
  whe you create a variable inside a control loop(IF-ELSE, WHILE LOOP, FOR LOOP etc), the var keyword behaves as a global variable which can be accessed anywhere inside your file, but for let & const keyword they are local variables and can only be used inside the control loop.

Note - try and avoid using the var keyword in your code, rather use let and const keyword more in your code.

/*EJS Layouts*/
EJS does not specifically support blocks, but layouts cab be implemented by including headers and footers for consistentcy sake and helps reduce code duplicate:
<%- include('header') -%>

<%- include('footer') -%>
